An example generated readme
## Description
This is a javascript application that asks questions about your project and generates a readme file for it. This is built to save time on projects by having a script to most of the readme work. 
This application saves the user time on their projects. It taught me how to ustilize Node Package Manager and inquierer.

## Installation

Open in VSCode and type 
node index.js 
Into the terminal

## Usage
After entering node index.js the program will ask a series of questions, answer them and a readme.md file will be generated in the root directory.
## Credits
Node Package Manager
Inqierer 8.2.4
